# What is Hashing ...
- Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, values into the hash table by using a hash function. It is done for faster access to elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.
# What is PreComputation ...
- It is the process of counting something in advanced and the later on refrencing it when we need it fututre time .
- we can use it to reduce the time complexity to a great extent.
- Since we precomputed the whole thing its just a matter of time that we need to refrence it in O(n) time complexity.

#   Hashing + Precomputation = LOVE
-   Its a common technique to start a problem by precomputing and simulatneously hashing it into another array.
- When running queries we just need to refrence the array HASH array.
